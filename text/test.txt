I. I NTRODUCT ION 
Your goal is to simulate the usual appeara nce of pape rs in 
an IEEE confe rence procee dings. For item s not addressed in  
these instructi ons, please refer t o the last issue of your 
confere nce’s procee dings or your Pu blication s chair. 
Prep aring your Electronic Paper 
Prepare y our paper in full-size fo rmat, on U S letter pape r (8 
½ by  11 inches). For A4 paper, use the A4 settings. 
Type Sizes and Typ efaces: Follo w the typ e sizes sp ecified  in 
Table I. As an  aid in gauging type si ze, 1 point is about 0.35 
mm. Th e size o f the lowercase letter “j ” will g ive the poin t 
size. Tim es New Rom an is the prefe rred font. 
1) US Letter Ma rgins: top = 0.75 inches, bo ttom = 1 inch, 
side = 0.625 inche s. Each c olumn measures 3.5 inc hes wide,  
with a 0.25-inch measurem ent between columns. 
2) A4 Mar gins: top = 19mm, bot tom = 43mm, side = 1 3 
mm. The A4 column width is 88m m (3.45 i n). The s pace 
between  the two columns is 4 mm (0.17 in). Paragraph  
indentation is 3.5 mm (0.14 in). 
Left- and  right-justify you r columns. Use tab les an d figures 
to adjust co lumn length. On the last page of your  paper, adjust 
the len gths of th e co lumns so  that the y are equal. Use 
automatic h yphenation and check sp elling. Dig itize or paste  
down figures.

II. H ELPFUL  HINTS 
A. Figures and Tables 
Position  figures and  tables at th e tops and bottoms of 
columns.  Avo id placing  them in the middle of co lumns.  
Large figures and tables may span across both c olumns.  
Figure capt ions should be centered below the figures; table 
captions should be cent ered above.  Avoid placing fi gures and 
tables b efore th eir first mention in the tex t.  Use th e 
abbreviation “Fig. 1,” even at the beginning of a sentence. 
Figure ax is lab els are ofte n a source of confusion. Us e 
words rather th an symb ols.  For ex ample, write 
“Magnet ization,” or “Magnetization (M)” not  just “M.”  Put 
units in parentheses.  Do not label axes on ly with units.  In the 
example, write “Mag netization  (A/m )” or “Mag netizatio n (A ⋅ 
m1).” Do  not label axes with a ratio of quantities an d units.  
For e xample, write “Tem perature  (K),” not “Tem perature/K.” 
Multipliers can  be esp ecially co nfusing.  Write  
“Magnetization (kA/m )” or “M agnetization (103 A/m).” 
Figure lab els should be legible, abou t 10-po int type. 
B. References 
Number citatio ns con secutively in  square b rackets [1].   
Punctuation  follows th e bracket [2 ]. Refer sim ply to the 
reference  number, as in  [3]. Use “Re f. [3]” or Reference [3]” at 
the be ginni ng of a se ntence: “Refere nce [3] was t he first …” 
Num ber footnotes sepa rately in supersc ripts.  Place t he 
actual foo tnote at th e bottom of the column in which it was 
cited .  Do  not put footnotes in the referen ce list.  Use let ters 
for table f ootnotes (see Ta ble I).  IEEE Tr ansactions  no long er 
use a journal prefix before the vol ume num ber.  For example, 
use “ IEEE  Tran s. Magn ., vol. 25,” not “vol. MAG -25. Give all authors’ names; use “et al.”  if there are six authors 
or more.  Papers that have not been published, even if they 
have been submitted for publication, should be cited as “unpublished” [4].  Papers that have been accepted for publication should be cited as “in press” [5].  In a paper title, 
capitalize the first word and all other words except for 
conjunctions, prepositions less than seven letters, and prepositional phrases. 
For papers published in translated journals, first give the 
English citation, then the original foreign-language citation [6]. 
C. Abbreviations and Acronyms 
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are 
used in the text, even if they have been defined in the abstract.  Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title unless they are unavoidable. 
D. Equations 
Number equations consecutively with equation numbers in 
parentheses flush with the right margin, as in (1).  To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents.  Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols.  
Use an en dash (–) rather than a hyphen for a minus sign.  Use 
parentheses to avoid ambiguities in denominators.  Punctuate equations with commas or period s when they are part of a 
sentence, as in  
 
 a + b = c. (1) 
 
Symbols in your equation should be defined before the 
equation appears or immediately following.  Use “(1),” not “Eq. (1)” or “equation (1),” except at the beginning of a 
sentence:  “Equation (1) is …” 
E. Other Recommendations 
The Roman numerals used to number the section headings 
are optional.  If you do use them, do not number 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT  and R EFERENCES , and begin Subheadings 
with letters.  Use two spaces after periods (full stops).  Hyphenate complex modifi ers: “zero-field-cooled 
magnetization.”  Avoid dangling participles, such as, “Using (1), the potential was calculated.”  Write instead, “The 
potential was calculated using (1),” or “Using (1), we 
calculated the potential.” 
Use a zero before decimal point s:  “0.25,” not “.25.” Use 
“cm3,” not “cc.”  Do not mix complete spellings and 
abbreviations of units:  “Wb/m2” or “webers per square 
meter,” not “webers/m2.” Spell units when they appear in text:  
“…a few henries,” not “…a few H.” If your native language is 
not English, try to get a native English-speaking colleague to proofread your paper.  Do not add page numbers. III. U NITS 
Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as  primary units. (SI units are 
encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as “3.5-inch disk drive.” 
Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in 
amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation. 
IV. S OME COMMON MISTAKES  
The word “data” is plural, not singular.  The subscript for 
the permeability of vacuum 0 is zero, not a lowercase letter “o.”  
In American English, peri ods and commas are within 
quotation marks, like “this period.”  A parenthetical statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this).  (A parenthetical sentence  is punctuated 
within the parentheses.)  A graph within a graph is an “inset,” not an “insert.”  The word alte rnatively is preferred to the 
word “alternately” (unless you mean something that 
alternates).  Do not use th e word “essentially” to mean 
“approximately” or “effectively.”  Be aware of the different meanings of the homophone s “affect” and “effect,” 
“complement” and “compliment,” “discreet” and “discrete,” “principal” and “principle.”  Do not confuse “imply” and “infer.”  The prefix “non” is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.  There is no period after the “et” in the Latin abbreviation “et al.”  The abbreviation “i.e.” means “that is ,” and the abbreviation “e.g.” 
means “for example.”  An exce llent style manual for science 
writers is [7]. 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT  
The preferred spelling of th e word “acknowledgment” in 
America is without an “e” afte r the “g.”  Try to avoid the 
stilted expression, “One of us (R. B. G.) thanks …” Instead, try “R.B.G. thanks …”  Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
